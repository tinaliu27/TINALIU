                        <h2>In this summer project for the Millburn Short Hills Historical Society, other MHS students and I conducted historical interviews. We uncovered informative facts and journeys from the last 100 years to help perserve the town's history. Although most calls were through zoom, we were able to produce insightful conversations with multiple residents in Millburn and Short Hills. </h2>

                        <h2>Through this project, fellow Millburn High School seniors and I wanted to bridge the gaps within the older and younger generations by conducting meaningful conversations. Through these conversations, we uncovered insightful perspectives and thoughts on the drastic changes in Millburn / Short Hills.  </h2>

                        <h1>Research</h1>
                        <h2>Before conducting any interviews at all, each of the interns decided to come up with a list of questions to ask. Some of the questions included:</h2>
                        <h2><i>What are your favorite memories of downtown Millburn?</i></h2>
                        <h2><i>What are some of your favorite places that are no longer around?</i></h2>
                        <h2><i>What places in Millburn are most important to you?</i></h2>
                        <h2><i>What do you think is better about Millburn than before?</i></h2>
                        <h2><i>What do you miss the most about Millburn?</i></h2>
                        <h2><i>What are the major differences you see now in our community vs. what you remember in the past?</i></h2>
                        <h2>After curating a comprehensive list of questions, a few interns and I conducted in person/virtual interviews with multiple residents. We all had the privilege to listen and learn about our town's past and all these questions were answered with thoughtful perspectives. While conducting these interviews, I truly understood why so many people are attached to small towns and why people decide to stay in one town for the entire lives. You can listen to each of these interviews via the link below!</h2>
                        <h2>After all the inteviews were conducted, they were shown to the Township Council.</h2>

                        <h1>Conclusion</h1>
                        <h2>Despite having to quarantine during the peak of the pandemic, I realized the significance of keeping in touch with the community, especially in small towns. It was an exciting experience getting to know my town more and it absolutely impacted my perspective on suburban towns. Now, I understand the appeal and historical charm of small towns, impacting my view on urbanization and gentrification. Feel free to click the links below and learn more about my town! </h2>
