                        <h2>The game's functionalities were very limited. First off, the ball didn't bounce correctly from the paddle. I wanted to revise this issue in the newest game. Secondly, I wanted to change the game into a 2 person game to increase the difficulty. Thirdly, I wanted to include a reset button so I wouldn't need to rerun the code if I wanted to restart. Lastly, I changed the paddle to move from the mouse to the following keyboard keys: 'UP arrow', 'DOWN arrow', 'A', and 'Z'. </h2>
